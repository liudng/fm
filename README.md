## Features

- **Dual-pane layout**: Switchable horizontal/vertical orientation, independently adjustable split ratio, single-pane hide support
- **Multi-tab**: Each pane supports multiple tabs with independent navigation history, drag-to-reorder, clone, and close
- **File operations**: Copy, move, rename, delete, trash, properties — executed asynchronously with a progress dialog
- **Conflict resolution**: Overwrite / skip / rename / apply-to-all options when encountering name collisions during copy/move
- **Favorites**: Save and restore the current dual-pane layout and tab paths with one click
- **Session restore**: Automatically saves and restores the last window state, pane layout, tab paths, and sort settings
- **Volume management**: File menu lists mounted volumes (QStorageInfo) and external removable devices (UDisks2) with mount/unmount/eject support
- **Clipboard**: Cut/copy/paste, cross-pane cut/copy, copy path/filename
- **Configurable shortcuts**: All shortcuts are customizable via the settings dialog with instant effect
- **Themes & icons**: UI theme (QStyleFactory) and icon theme are configurable
- **Internationalization**: Chinese / English switching

## Dependencies

### Runtime

```bash
sudo apt install libqt6widgets6 libqt6concurrent6 libqt6dbus6 libqt6network6 \
    udisks2 gnome-icon-theme
```

### Development Tools

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake qt6-l10n-tools
```

### Development Libraries

```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools
```

## Build

```bash
cd fm-qt
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The built binary is located at `build/fm`.

## Installation

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```

Installs to `/usr/local/bin/fm` by default.

## Running

```bash
./build/fm
```

Or after installation:

```bash
fm
```

The application automatically restores the last session on startup. If an instance is already running, a new process brings the existing window to the foreground and exits (single-instance mode).

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `~/.config/fm/fm.conf` (INI format). All settings can be modified through the Settings dialog and take effect immediately.
